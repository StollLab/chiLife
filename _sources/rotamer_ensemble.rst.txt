Side chain ensembles
=====================


RotamerEnsemble
---------------
The :class:`RotamerEnsemble` is the base class for (monofunctional) side chain ensemble objects. It contains all the
methods and attributes that are shared between standard canonical amino acids and specialized and non-canonical amino
acids.

SpinLabel
---------

:class:`chilife.SpinLabel` s are the primary feature of Ï‡Life. :class:`chilife.SpinLabel` inherits from the
:class:`chilife.RotamerEnsemble` object and therefore has all the same properties and methods . Additionally
:class:`chilife.SpinLabel` have several other features unique to spin labels and useful for protein and spin label
modeling.

dRotamerEnsemble
-----------------
The :class:`dRotamerEnsemble` is the base class for bifunctional side chain ensemble objects. Like
:class:`chilife.RotamerEnsemble`, it contains all the methods and attributes that are shared between all bifunctional
amino acids whether they are spin labels or other bifunctional non-canonical amino acids.
