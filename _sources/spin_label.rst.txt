==========

SpinLabels are the primary feature of Ï‡Life. SpinLabel inherits from the RotamerEnsemble object
and therefore has all the properties and methods offered by the :ref:`RotamerEnsemble <rotamer_ensemble>`
object. Additionally SpinLabels have several other features unique to spin labels and useful
for protein and spin label modeling.
